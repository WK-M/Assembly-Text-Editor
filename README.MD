# Assembly Text Editor Created By Kendall Molas

## Background
This is an assembly text editor with vim-like features such as the movement and deleting at cursor position. In addition to the vim-like features, I have added a drawing option which allows users to draw boxes. A unique features about these boxes is that there is a "block" detection which prevents letters from overwriting the boxes.

## To Run:
- DOSBOX

```
tasm main
tlink main /t
main
```
